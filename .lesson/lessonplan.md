# Week 3 Overview

Welcome back!

You just completed your second week and should now know how to use repl.it! Congrats! 

This week, we will dive right in to coding your first real-python scripts and testing them for the homework. You will learn about basic Python syntax, and how to use the "strings" datatype to create our own variables. You will also learn how to structure your code and define functions that get arguments from argparse, and run code in main(). This helps us write our code like a pro, and make our code reusable. And because writing all that code takes time, we are going to learn how to write code from a template (based on new.py), where we can define arguments and use as a starting point for writing code. Wow, that is some powerful stuff! Do you know that programmers on my team use this every day for writing code? It might seem cumbersome to learn at first, but you will be writing code faster and with perfect structure, that other programmers can easily follow and re-use.

This week, we will also learn how to manipulate strings, compare them, and create branches in our scripts that allows for different code to be executed depending on the values of our variables. Lastly, we will take a look at formatting and providing the output to the user. Knowing how to structure your code and functions, and how to make your code act in different ways depending on different values is at the heart of python programming!

Next step, you can put everything you've learned to the test in the graded homework assignment and for the practice quiz. Don't worry if you don't get everything right the first time. You can do the Practice quizes (in D2L) 2x to improve your score. And the homework comes with a test suite that shows you your score and suggests how you can improve it. When you are ready, submit your homework in repl.it. Be sure to reach out over slack if you need any help at all, or attend office hours. I'll catch up with you there.
